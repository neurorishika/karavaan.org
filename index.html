									<h2 class="major">Leadership Conclave</h2>

									<p>The Panel discussion on the topic - 'Budget in basic science: from a cash-crunched past to the future forwardâ€™, 
									is to be held on Thursday, November 1, 2018, from 7 PM at the Sir CV Raman Auditorium, IISER Pune. </br>
									The primary intent behind putting together this panel of speakers from a wide range of backgrounds is to provide a 
									common platform for all the diverse perspectives to weigh in into those policy decisions which determine the course 
									of scientific progress in our country. </br>
									
									By dissecting this theme, we seek to discuss and bring forth into the public theatre the following issues as starters :-</br>
									<ul>
										<li>A brief analysis of the current scenario in funding of basic sciences.</li>
										<li>Usage of the taxpayer's money to fund what one may term "socially irrelevant" research.</li>
										<li>Parallels between a society's progress and a flourishing scientific community.</li>
										<li>Scope of and qualms surrounding industrial funding of research in the basic sciences.</li>
										<li>Future of research in the basic sciences in India with current gears in place</li>
										<li>The potential of a self-sustaining scientific community in India and a roadmap to achieving that.</li>
									</ul>
									
									The Panel will be composed of five members (from Industry, Academia and Administration) and will commence with ten-minute 
									talks by everyone on their varied opinions on the nuances of the matter at hand. The main discussion will follow thereafter, 
									and we intend to close with a session of open interaction with the audience.</br>

								<br />
								<h3>About Pronite:</h3>
								<p>Pronite is definitely one of the (if not the) most awaited events of Karavaan. 
								Traditionally the last night of Karavaan, Pronite is when everyone, students and 
								faculty alike, come out to the Main Stage on the cricket ground and cut loose for
								 a night of great music, delicious food and unending fun. With Pronites in previous 
								 years boasting of the likes of Indian Ocean, The Local Train, Lagori and Sorabh Pant, 
								 it's not difficult to see why Pronite is an unforgettable part of every Karavaan. 
								 Professional musicians and performers take to the stage to light up the evening, 
								 providing a perfect finale to Karavaan. </br>
								This year, Pronite will be on 4th November, and we have an exciting line-up of performances 
								this year too. So save the date!</p>
								
								
								<h3>About the Artists:</h3>

								hawk-eyed fellowâ€™s caustic sense of humour. So brace yourselves for his performance on Sunday 
								that is sure to have you cracking up with hilarity and wishing it never ends.</p>

								<p>Karunesh Talwar based in the happening Mumbai scene, defines stand-up comedy gold standard. 
								This happy-go-lucky cynic, known for his often risque and cutting edge humour, is one who is not 
								afraid to exercise his fundamental right to free speech. And he brings all of that and more to 
								IISER, where you can expect his jokes to fly thick and fast, leaving everyone in an uproar.</p>
								
								<h4>Agam</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/agam.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
								<p>Karavaan is the annual science, cultural, and social fest of <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in">IISER Pune</a>. 
								Born in 2008 as a small intra-college festival, it has grown with each edition and has now matured into something far greater.</p>
								<p>The 11th edition of Karavaan is scheduled to occur on 2nd, 3rd and 4th of November, 2018. These three days will be sprawling with a 
								plethora of competitions and activities spanning areas like music, dance, photography, science, quizzing, drama, literary, and general 
								tomfoolery. Eminent personalities from all over India from niche fields will also be invited to join us in a number of much-awaited 
								talk series and workshops on a variety of subjects on the days leading up to, as well as during Karavaan. 
								The theme for this year, <i>"Fandoms and Fiction"</i> , will in no small measure, leave a mark on the minds of everyone who joins us for the fest that is Karavaan.</p>
