								<h3>Live Performances</h3>
								
								<h3>About Pronite:</h3>
								<p>Pronite is definitely one of the (if not the) most awaited events of Karavaan. 
								Traditionally the last night of Karavaan, Pronite is when everyone, students and 
								faculty alike, come out to the Main Stage on the cricket ground and cut loose for
								 a night of great music, delicious food and unending fun. With Pronites in previous 
								 years boasting of the likes of Indian Ocean, The Local Train, Lagori and Sorabh Pant, 
								 it's not difficult to see why Pronite is an unforgettable part of every Karavaan. 
								 Professional musicians and performers take to the stage to light up the evening, 
								 providing a perfect finale to Karavaan. </br>
								This year, Pronite will be on 4th November, and we have an exciting line-up of performances 
								this year too. So save the date!</p>
								
								
								<h3>About the Artists:</h3>
								<h4>Agam</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/agam.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Karavaan is the annual science, cultural, and social fest of <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in">IISER Pune</a>. 
								Born in 2008 as a small intra-college festival, it has grown with each edition and has now matured into something far greater.</p>
								<p>The 11th edition of Karavaan is scheduled to occur on 2nd, 3rd and 4th of November, 2018. These three days will be sprawling with a 
								plethora of competitions and activities spanning areas like music, dance, photography, science, quizzing, drama, literary, and general 
								tomfoolery. Eminent personalities from all over India from niche fields will also be invited to join us in a number of much-awaited 
								talk series and workshops on a variety of subjects on the days leading up to, as well as during Karavaan. 
								The theme for this year, "Fandom and Fiction" , will in no small measure, leave a mark on the minds of everyone who joins us for the fest that is Karavaan.</p>
